  <h1>What is Weber?</h1>
  <p>Weber is a full web application scaffold for building heavy-duty webapps.</p>
  <p>
    Developing web applications is a lot of work. It involves setting up scaffolding for your backend and frontend code, deciding on a general structure and setting up deployment and upgrades. This often causes developers to spend a lot of time on boilerplate when they <strong>should</strong> be focusing on their actual app logic.
  </p>
  <p>
    Weber aims to solve that, getting you started coding, testing and deploying your projects in no-time.

      <h1>Robust Backend</h1>
      <p>Weber is built around Flask - a proven, industry standard web framework. It avoids clutter and keeps your code organized and readable.</p>

      <h1>Ambitious Frontend</h1>
      <p>Weber includes Ember.js as a frontend framework. It includes everything needed to develop, debug and integrate the frontend code right into your project.</p>

      <h1>Powerful Deployment</h1>
      <p>Weber uses Ansible for deployment - covering all bases, but keeping you in control. Weber supports CentOS, Debian, Ubuntu and Arch Linux deployments out of the box</p>

      <h1>Batteries Included</h1>
      <p>Weber contains everything you'll probably need to build rich, useful web services - background tasks with Celery, caching with Redis, serving HTTP with Nginx and Gunicorn, and more </p>

  <h3>Need a Different Mix?</h3>

  <p>Weber comes pre-loaded with all you should need to write a full stack app, but in some cases you want to get started with less. Luckily we also provide two additional flavors of Weber for simpler projects:</p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>weber-backend</strong> Includes all backend functionality, but does not have a frontend pipeline</li>
    <li><strong>weber-micro</strong> Only contains deployment and an app skeleton, skipping DB, frontend, background workers etc.</li>
  </ol>
